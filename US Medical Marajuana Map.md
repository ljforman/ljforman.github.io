## US Medical Marajuana Legalization

####I mapped US medical marajuana legalization in 2000 and 2014 to show the difference in approvals by state. Blue states denote legal medical marajuana uses. Red states have not yet legalized medical marajuana.

You can see from the red/blue deliniation clearly that medical marajuana has become legal in many more states from 2000 to 2014. However, based upon the sea of red that remains in the 2014 map (mostly in the South), it's clear there is still a way to go before medical marajuana becomes a "universal" legality nationwide.
