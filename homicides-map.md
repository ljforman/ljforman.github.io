##Gun Related Deaths in US

My map illustrates gun deaths across the US (view is mostly continental US for a bigger picture).Yellow dots indicate areas where there were less than 30 gun-related deaths; big red stars indicate areas where there were more. I think the map does a nice job of clearly illustrating where more gun related deaths took place relative to the rest of the country. Having said that, there is an obvious correlation between large incidences of gun deaths and population. A closer look shows that pretty much all areas with over 30 deaths are in major cities (e.g. Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Las Vegas, etc). This is a clear limitation of this data. Perhaps looking at data of each individual city by area would help, although then there would likely be more deaths in the most dense areas of the city. Another idea is to plot the deaths within the same city across different times of day or year. You could do this by layering data on a map or even displaying the same map side by side based on different times of day/year. This would control for population density.
